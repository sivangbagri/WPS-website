    <h1>About WPS Aligarh:</h1>
    A school is an educational institution designed
    to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction
    of
    teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[2] In these systems,
    students
    progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section
    below)
    but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed
    primary education.
    An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these
    higher education i
    nstitutions are usually not compulsory.

    In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary
    (Elementary in the
    US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very
    young children (typically ages 3â€“5).
    University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be
    dedicated to one particular field, such
    as a school of economics or a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and
    methods.

    Non-government schools, called also known as private schools[3] may be required when the government does not supply
    adequate, or
    specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools,
    Gurukula,Hindu School, madrasa, hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have
    a higher
    standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of
    corporate training,
    military education and training and business schools.
